# Introduction to Databases and SQL

> Tue, 28 Apr 2020

- What is a database?
  - separate program that runs on your computer
  - designed to handle data: can handle LOTS of data
  - you communicate with a database using **commands** (very much like command line)
  - 99% of commands are SQL
  - many different implementations of a database:
    - PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MariaDB, etc
    - Relational database
  - has users, passwords, roles for permissions, etc
    - kind of like a mini-operating system

- What is SQL? sequel
  - Structured Query Language
  - a new language with new syntax (ie: not JavaScript, not HTML, etc)
  - the basic commands work the same on pretty much all databases
  - `SELECT * FROM table_name`

- Goals for tonight:
  - get PostgreSQL installed
  - set up a GUI tool like DBeaver or Postico
  - set up a database
  - practice some INSERT and SELECT statements
