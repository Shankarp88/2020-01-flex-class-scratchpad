- Phase I is coming to an end!

- Phase I projects start this Saturday. We will make the teams.

- Reminder: it is totally OK to not be 100% on all these topics
  - learning happens over time, at different rates
  - A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step

- Phase I review topics:
  - git and command line
  - JavaScript language basics:
    - syntax, variables, simple types, functions, objects, arrays, loops
    - how to solve problems using code
  - HTML
    - basic tag knowledge
    - what is "semantic markup"
    - HTML has a structure like a tree: siblings, children, parents
  - CSS
    - syntax, selectors
    - common properties and attributes
    - layout with Flexbox
    - ability to use a CSS framework like Bootstrap
    - how to add to HTML with `<link>` and `<style>` tags
  - JS in the browser
    - how to add to an HTML page with `<script>` tag
    - What is the DOM? Mapping of HTML structure to JS API
    - basic DOM manipulation
    - event handlers: click a button, run a JS function
    - rendering abstraction: map JS data to HTML with a function
    - AJAX: make a network request from the browser
  - Promises (Phase I bonus)
    - generic wrapper around asynchronous things
  - Scene-it exercise is a good overall exercise that touches most of these concepts
-
There is a very optional ES6 lecture open in Schoology if anyone wants to look at that tonight
