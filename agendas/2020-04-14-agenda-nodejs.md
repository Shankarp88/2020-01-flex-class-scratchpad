- Phase I projects were great!
  - Aside from "things in the browser", I think everyone learned that there is a
    lot of complexity that comes from working with a team.
  - git, communication, merge conflicts, product design, etc
  - practice, practice, practice

- Phase II begins today!
  - backend / servers / node.js / databases
  - learning a lot of new concepts, vocabulary
  - complexity of code can be simpler, other things are harder
  - more APIs to learn

- This first week is getting started with node.js, npm, and express.js on Saturday

- Quiz
  - instructor feedback at the end

- What is Node.js? (slides)
  - JavaScript on the server
  - everything is asynchronous by default
